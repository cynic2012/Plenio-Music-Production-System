"""Lyrics fidelity: how closely a take sings its lyrics - one take, or the best of two or three (owner's
request 2026-10-24).

A music model does not always sing its lyrics: it leaves a line out, repeats one, sings other words. In the
owner's 37 sung YuE2 takes of 2026-10-23/24 the median take sang 89 % of its lyrics' words as written (heard
by the lyrics ASR), and one in six less than 75 % - the same documents sang a verse 8 of 65 words in one take
and 64 of 65 in the next. YuE2's own evaluation keeps the better of two takes for the same reason. So:

- **standard**: one take, as before;
- **high**: a second take with the next seed, and the take that sings more of the lyrics is kept;
- **highest**: as high, and a third take when neither of the two sang at least ``TARGET`` of the words.

Each further take costs a render and a hearing: the generation takes up to about twice (high) or three times
(highest) as long. Instrumentals and songs without sung lyrics always take one take. Pure; no audio.

"""Sung Pitch: the vocal line of a recording as a pitch curve for the score editor (owner's request
2026-10-03: a cover's original singing over the transcribed notes).

The vocal stem comes from a separation model in ``models/audio_separation`` (the one Separate Stems
uses), the curve from ``core.audio.pitch`` (YIN, NumPy). The curve is display only: Song Sheet shows
it in the piano roll and never sends it anywhere. Without a separation model - or when the separation
fails - the node still finishes: its output says why there is no curve, and the run goes on.

The stem itself is an output too (owner 2026-10-24): Transcribe Lyrics hears it besides the mix and keeps the
more confident hearing. Without a stem the output is empty, and Transcribe Lyrics hears the mix alone.

"""Start the studio - ComfyUI - from the player (owner's request 2026-10-26: the player runs on its own; ComfyUI is
started only to make songs, and nobody has to open a workflow for it).

The player finds the ComfyUI it is installed in (``ComfyUI/custom_nodes/<Plenio>``: ``main.py`` two folders up), or the
folder the admin chose, and starts it in the background: the Python of that ComfyUI (the portable build's embedded
Python, a ``.venv``) or the one the player runs on, ``main.py`` and the arguments the admin set in Settings
(``--models-directory D:/models``, ``--cuda-device 1`` …) - a fixed argument list, no shell, no window, detached; its
output in ``comfyui.log`` in the player's state folder. It listens on this computer only: ``--listen`` and
``--enable-cors-header`` are refused (*In your network* is the network's way in, with its link). A ComfyUI the player
started can be stopped from it - by hand, or when nothing was made for a while -; one started otherwise is never
touched. When the admin wishes, a song ordered while ComfyUI is not running starts it.

Standard library only.
